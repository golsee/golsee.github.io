                Welcome to Golsee's Birthday Wishlist! Golsee's birthday is on November 28th. As she is getting older she
                is starting to have a harder time thinking about gift ideas for her friends and family who ask her about what she would
                like for her birthday. Although she has wants, she often finds herself not thinking they are necessary so she doesn't
                really keep track of them anymore unfortunately (or fortunately?). Anways, she decided to create this website to keep 
                track of some things she has found that she is interested in and to help her friends and family out when deciding on a 
                gift for her.
