                The Long-Term Want List is the list of items that I feel like I would use now and
                even in a couple years. These items tend to be more expensive; they can be technology,
                furniture, or things that I feel like I would be able to appreciate for a long time. Please
                do not feel like you have to buy something off of this list; these are just things that I've
                thought of. I don't expect them. The colored items have a link to them for easy finding.
                Thank you!</p>
